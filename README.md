I designed the project for my capstone project (final project).
It is an automotive shop website. 
Technologies used are MongoDB, Express.js, React.js Node.js, Restful APIs, tailwind CSS, and TypeScript with the implementation of the 
Client-server architectural pattern. 
The website also includes an embedded chatbot for enhanced customer services and operational efficiency. 
The website still handles some code improvements in terms of clean code architecture, the complete use
of TypeScript in the client section of the public section, and adding statues for the restful APIs.
The report of the project which was delivered in the Capstone project is also uploaded to the repository.
