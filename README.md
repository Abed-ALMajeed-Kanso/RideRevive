RideRevive is a streamlined automotive shop web application. It includes a public section for browsing and buying products, 
viewing old purchases (require authentication of course), and other suitable features for a shop application. An embedded chatbot
is also integrated. Also it includes a administration section for handling products and customer data. Technologies used 
are MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, RESTful APIs, and Tailwind CSS. The project was a part of my capstone university course.
